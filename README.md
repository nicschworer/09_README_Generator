## Description 
This ReadMe generator package can be used to create a high-quality readme.md file for your repo, complete with license and badges. It uses Inquirer to collect user input and promises to ensure that certain steps complete before moving on to others. When using, note that case and spelling matter.

Please find a video of it being used [here](/demo.mov).
